         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The firſte and principall, vvas the dutie and ſeruice, vvhich I ovve to God, vvho vvoulde not onely that by preaching and reading, but alſo by al other meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I should ſeke the aduauncement of his kingdome.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:10354:3"/>
            <p>The nexte vvas my zele tovvardes the houſe of God: the ruinous and decayed ſtate wherof in this later age of the world I coulde neither forget vvithout impietie, nor remember vvithout compaſsion, nor paſſe ouer, and neglecte vvithoute great burden of conſcience.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt cauſe that prouoked me, vvas that I mighte enter into ſome pore account touching the courſe &amp; race of my vvhole life, ſpent for the moſt parte of it in the Vniuerſitie of Oxford, aſvvell to other my good Lords and Patrones, to whom I am muche beholding, as namely alſo to your Honoure, vvhom not only we Oxford men acknovvledge as oure good Lord and Chanceller, but alſo next vnder the Queenes Maieſtie, our cheefe heade. VVhoſe honourable and curteous nature both shevved to other my far betters, and from me, thoughe vnworthye, at no time vvithdravvne, vvhat it mighte iuſtly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and whoſe great authoritie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ouer vs, what laufully and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly it might commaund, I could not be ignorant in any vviſe. It came therfore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to my remembraunce, that ſeing
<pb facs="tcp:10354:3"/> your Honor, with other the furtherers of our ſtudies, haue ſo honorably ſpared me your good vvord, I could neither without infamie hold my peace, nor without want of good aduiſement, not giue oute ſome teſtimonie of my bounden duetie.</p>
            <p>And for this purpoſe (to confeſſe vnto your Honor the very truthe) howe ſmall ſoeuer mine habilitie vvas: yet rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient leaſure of me muche deſired this great vvhile, than any goodvvill vtterly was wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting. But as God worketh ſecrete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many ſundry vvayes to helpe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which he wold haue done: at the laſt in dede fell oute oportunitie of me not ſo muche coueted or vvished for, as heartily lamented and bevvailed, that the plague daily growing and encreaſing in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of Oxford, &amp; the publike lectures being for the very ſame cauſe intermitted hoping by Goddes aſsiſtance to prouide ſufficiently for meſelf, more of a ſtudious minde, than greatly vrged by any neede (for my frendes, hearing at the laſt where I vvas, vvrote me earneſt letters to come downe vnto them) amongſt other I there remained. VVholely therefore being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
<pb facs="tcp:10354:4"/> and giuen to contemplation, from the which at that time there was no great encombrance that might pull me backe, I began nowe ſeriouſly to minde the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting oute and publishing of ſome booke.</p>
            <p>And being fully determined to wryte, vpon the matter notwithſtanding vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon I might fitlieſt grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my proceſſe, I was not by and by reſolued. Sometimes it came into my minde, to take in hande ſome controuerſie of this time. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with meſelf what great learning hath bene lately shewed in ſuch queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I was quickly chaunged from that mind. For vvhat could any body novv vvryte of, for the improuing or defending of ſuche things, which very plentifully alredy hath not bene diſcourſed? VVould a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gladly be inſtructed touching the vſe of images? let him peruſe D. Calfehils boke againſt Martial. VVold he heare what can be ſaid of the Maſſe? Not only maſter Deane of Paules his bokes againſt Dorman are to be ſene, but alſo the treatiſe of the righte reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d father bishop Cowper, entituled <hi>The defenſe of the truth against the maſſe,</hi> and the works of the late famous bishop
<pb facs="tcp:10354:4"/> of vvorthy memorie D. Iewel. VVho in tvvo of his greate Volumes, hathe gone through with ſo many, &amp; ſo profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, that for diuers needefull poynts to be ſpoken of, they might vvell ſerue a Diuine for common place bokes.</p>
            <p>Therfore taking more diligent &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite deliberation, after many other things vvhich I thought vpon, the very time and place vvhere I then vvas, and the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Goddes Prouident care for me from my youth, and (notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding my diligence in taking heede,) not leaſt of al declared towardes me at that time, made me in loue (as it vvere) vvith the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Prouidence.</p>
            <p>Therwithal (which inflamed me not a litle the more) it could neither be hidden nor vnknowne vnto me, howe graciouſly beſides our deſeruing, hovv vvonderfully beyond al reaſon, God hath lately prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with his mightie hand, not only our ſoueraigne Lady the Queenes highneſſe, but vniuerſally the vvhole ſtate of this realme. For (o good Lorde) vvhat ſubtile vndermining what crafty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueying, what cruell conſpiring hathe bene attempted?
<pb facs="tcp:10354:5"/> VVhat miſcheuous heades, vvhat ſlie pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, vvhat vngodly deuiſes haue beene founde oute? VVhiche neither by anye mannes vviſedome coulde come to light, vvhen they vvere hidde: nor by mannes ſtrength and pollicie coulde be repreſſed, when they were broken out. But that god, whoſe prouident eye neuer ſlepeth, whoſe head is alvvayes carefull and mindefull of vs, whoſe arme ſtretched out is neuer idle, vvhen none other vviſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel could take place, by his maruellous forſighte hathe prouided for vs, and vvhen ſtrengthe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to faile vs, hath pitched his tent rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about in our defenſe. Therfore may it wel be ſaide of theſe our priuie vnderminers, as <hi>Tullie</hi> that Romaine oratoure ſpake in his firſt inuectiue againſt <hi>Catiline: They doe nothing, they goe aboute nothing, they thincke of nothing, but by and by we do not heare of it only, but we ſee it alſo, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feele it with oure handes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And vvhereunto, I beſeeche your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, shoulde vve aſcribe this ſo greate a benefit, but to the Prouidence of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God? <hi>By whoſe aide and furderance</hi> (to vſe againe <hi>Tullies</hi> ovvne vvords, vvhich he

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a Prouerbe</hi> amongſt the Grekes of no ſmal antiquitie, welbeloued in our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, that <hi>if in euils any good may be founde, the ſame muſt be ſifted oute.</hi> A godly leſſon ſurely, and very profitable to be obſerued in this ſo great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worlde: Whereby it is very plainly ſet out vnto vs, how we oughte of all things to make our greateſt aduauntage, not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhely diſcouraged with all fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde blaſtes, nor cowardly yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any crooked and ouerth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warte aſſaulte, but taking the world as God ſendeth it, to lerne dayly the experience of godly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and by all meanes to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oportunitie of well doing.
<pb facs="tcp:10354:7"/> Therefore whether we be afflicted in body or goods, we are taught by this Prouerbe to take holde of ſome godly leſſon: or if the loue of our deare fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be any matier of diſcomforte to vs, we are willed to conſider with our ſelues, whether this euill be ſo incommodious, that no goodneſſe may grow out of the ſame: or if cloked falſehood and hypocriſie haue deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blinded vs, and led vs away, we are warned to loke well about vs, to ſee what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditic mighte ariſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Or finally whatſoeuer heauineſſe or miſchaunce ſhoulde touche vs, we are charged to enter into a diſcrete &amp; ſober meditation, whether in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we might learne to be the better for the ſame. If any ſweeteneſſe may be piked out of that that is ſoure, we muſt not by and by refuſe, &amp; caſt away either the nutkirnell for the huſke, or the corne for the chaffe, or the roſe for the prickes that growe about it: but
<pb facs="tcp:10354:8"/> waying all thinges with indifferent balaunce, we muſte picke oute ſuche mattier as may alwayes ſtande vs in good ſteede, and with great ſkill and aduiſement make our choyſe.</p>
            <p>Wherein the great wiſedome and Prouidence (ſhall I ſay, or elſe alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exceding mercy of almightie god?) as in all other thinges notably, ſo in this poynt wonderfully is diſcouered. Who as he whippeth vs many &amp; ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times with the rod of his ſharpe correction, to the intent our ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe might be wakned, &amp; our vnſtaied life &amp; conuerſation mighte be bridled with the yoke of diſcipline: ſo neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, leaſt we ſhould be to muche diſcouraged, there is no inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that euer befalleth to vs ſo great, nor no calamitie that beſetteth vs ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and voyde of comforte, but that alwayes there is annexed to it ſome one thing or other, that auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, and aſſuageth and mollifieth
<pb facs="tcp:10354:8"/> our griefe. Wherof it commeth, that although muche bitterneſſe be founde in the lyfe of man, and all things goe not alwayes as oure heartes deſire: yet by reaſon of this temperature, wherwith al things naturally be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, to the wiſe and godly there is nothing that ſeemeth intolerable, yea there is nothing that turneth them not to muche good.</p>
            <p>Whiche truely is not auouched of my parte as any idle inuention of mine owne brayne, but the ſame is playnely teſtifyed by the open ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gods worde, and by manifeſt examples proued true. For firſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> recorde of holy ſcripture, who hath not often heard to his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation the comfortable ſaying of the Prophet Dauid, affirming that the very lighte ſhineth in the middeſt of the darkneſſe to them that be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and feare God? Whereby his meaning is nothing elſe, but that
<pb facs="tcp:10354:9"/> to ſuch as be vpright, and keepe them ſelues vnſpotted of worldly blemiſhe (as by S. Iames admonition we are taught and informed by true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> God ſheweth him ſelfe amiable often tymes, when with the cloudes of diſpayre they ſeeme in maner to be ouerwhelmed. And S. Paule ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> at the ſame marke, ſaith playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that to them which loue God, all thinges generally frame to a good ende, be they neuer ſo comberouſly beſtadde, or ſo roughly and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly aſſayled.</p>
            <p>The ſame, if all authoritie were ſet aſide, as in a cleare myrrour, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented and ſhewed vnto vs in the dayly experience of the worlde. Of the ſtories of the ſacred Byble ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly knowen and talked of, what neede I to make long rehearſall? Wherein we ſee howe maruellouſly, contrary to al mens reaſon and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation god hath wrought for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
<pb facs="tcp:10354:9"/> of his elect: bringing efteſones (as we haue ſayde) the lighte out of the middeſt of the darkeneſſe, and vſing ſuche ſtraunge meanes for thy preſeruation, as ſurely in our carnall imagination would rather haue ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their vndoing.</p>
            <p>Who would euer haue thoughte, that Ioſephes bondage of his rule and lordeſhip, or his greeuous impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of his ſo honorable prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, woulde haue miniſtred ſo great occaſion? Not they ſurely that dyd perſecute hym: who contrarywyſe were vtterly of this minde, that there could not be poſſibly a more ſpeedie way to his deſtruction. Yet God ſo hampered his enimies, and ſo brake them of their malicious myndes, that not onely it was vayne, and voyde, whatſoeuer they diueliſhly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepted, but alſo ouerthrowing them in their owne deuiſes, he made them the very inſtrumentes that ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:10354:10"/> bring Ioſeph to honour. The infante Moſes, when in a panyer that was made of ruſhes, he was caſte downe into a ryuer, was he not in all mens iudgemente paſte hope for euer to haue eſcaped? Yet God ſo wrought in the childs greateſt extremitie, that not onely he eſcaped in that heauy caſe, but by Pharaoes owne daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that chaunced by Gods appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to paſſe by, he was brought vp, and foſtred as hir owne ſonne. The ſame is declared manyfeſtly by that which God did for the Iſraelites, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourning at their gret peril in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, by the hiſtory of Iudith and Heſter, and other mo. Wherby we ſee clerely without doubt, how true that anſwere was, which god made to S. Paule: <hi>Virtus mea in infirmitate perficitur .i.</hi> my power is wroght in mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note place="margin">2. Corinth. 12.</note> or, then is my valiauntneſſe and ſtrengthe moſte put in practiſe, when men ſhewe themſelues to be at the
<pb facs="tcp:10354:10"/> weakeſt.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe if any man here make exception, ſaying, that God doth not alwayes exalte thoſe, whom he hath humbled, or by the way of pouertie call menne to riches, or ſende them worldly proſperitie whome he hath afflicted with his heauy hande: if we ſpeake of this naughtie world, where wickedneſſe for the moſte parte bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſwaye, here in deede I graunte well, the godly are not alwayes ſo aduaunced.</p>
            <p>Yet this dare I boldly ſay, that god neuer ſuffereth them ſo heauily and intollerably to be oppreſſed, but that in the middeſt of all their euils he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out ſome way for them to releaſe their ſmarte. So that euen in their deepeſt miſeries and calamities they may either eſpie out ſome lighte of comforte, or elſe alſo take ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage by the ſame, that mighte ſerue them very agreably to ſome
<pb facs="tcp:10354:11"/> godly purpoſes. For we reade not in deede of our father Abraham, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fleing out of his natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, when he had ſet him ſelfe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully agaynſt many miſhappes and miſchaunces, he became by and by a great Lord, like Ioſeph. But yet we reade notwithſtanding, that bothe when he was in greate daunger by his wyues occaſion, and alſo after hir diſceſſe, in his greate anguiſhe and heauyneſſe, and in all other his manyfolde and moſte bitter troubles, God ſtyll was preſente with hym in ſuche ſorte, and ſo eaſed hym, and relieued hym at hys neede, that he bare all thinges peaceably wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute grutching, ſetting all worldely vanities at nought, in reſpecte of the lyfe to come.</p>
            <p>We reade not of king Dauid, that Princely prophet, that he neuer felte in mind and body any greefe and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that might diſquiete him. Nay
<pb facs="tcp:10354:11"/> contrarywiſe, we learne God ſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him often tymes, that he was welnigh waſted with ſtarke anguiſh and woe. Yet God was euer ſo farre of from forſaking him, that guyding him with the lighte of his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, he gaue him wiſedome and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie to picke good oute of euill.</p>
            <p>Whervpon he confeſſeth in his Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that the very rodde and ſtaffe, which he was beaten with, were his comforte, and that God humbled him and brought him lowe, not to dryue him to wanhope and diſpayre of hys goodneſſe, but to teache him his ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, and his ſtatutes.</p>
            <p>I paſſe ouer the Apoſtles of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chryſt: who many times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by the Iewiſhe Synagogue, did not alwayes eſcape their handes without all maner of harme. And yet whatſoeuer it was that they ſuffred, there was nothing that coulde caſte them vnder the feete. Yea it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:10354:12"/> of them in playne wordes, that when they were checked and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the Iewiſhe magiſtrates, and highe Prieſtes, <hi>they departed from their preſence with ioy and gladneſſe, that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Actes. 5.</note> 
               <hi>they were accepted as worthy to ſuffer any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes for the name of Chryſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither will I ſay any thing of the bleſſed Martyres, whoſe greate pacience and conſtancie had neuer ſo famouſly come to lyghte, if perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Tyrauntes hadde bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued.</p>
            <p>With one onely example of <hi>Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus Boetius</hi> I wyll ſtaye, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye meeſelfe. Hee beeyng (as wee reade) a ryghte worthy, wyſe and graue Senatoure, and one that had ſo well deſerued of the common weale, as no one of the Romayne Senatoures coulde doo more, was neuertheleſſe vppon diſpleaſure of the Emperoure Theodorike, eyther bycauſe he had ſeemed ouer-earneſt
<pb facs="tcp:10354:12"/> in maynteyning agaynſte hym the Senates honoure, or elſe (as ſome thynke) bycauſe he ſhewed him ſelfe zelouſe in impugning the ſecte of the Arrians, (vnto whoſe faction the ſayde Emperoure was thoughte to bee enclyned,) was not onely depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from hys highe eſtate, but alſo withoute any regarde hadde to his former merites, was fyrſt outlawed, and banyſhed, and afterwardes in his abſence, withoute hauing any aduocate to pleade hys cauſe (Oh vnwoorthy and vnſeemely dealing) was adiudged to dye by the ſame Senate, whome before ſo zealouſly he hadde ſupported. Neuertheleſſe he was ſo farre off from murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring agaynſt GOD, or too vnpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlye bearing thys vnkyndeneſſe, that he hath lefte behinde him a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry godly and learned monument of his Chriſtianly affected minde.</p>
            <p>So well coulde he vſe hys aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:10354:13"/> not onely for hys owne aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but alſo to the greate furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the poſteritie that ſhoulde come after.</p>
            <p>I for my parte muſte in deede of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie confeſſe, that I am no wyſe to be compared with any of theſe, not onely in none other thing, but alſo (God be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked) touching either proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie or aduerſitie. Who as I neuer had great wealthe, wherein I gyue place to many both better lerned, and more worthy: ſo ſurely neuer hitherto hath any ſuch worldly inconuenience chaunced vnto me, wherof I greatly made accounte.</p>
            <p>But yet as in an vnlike caſe, this (as meſeemeth) fell not out farre vnlike, which hapned to me ſoone after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer this laſt yere. Who firſt flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Oxforde, where I was in daunger, to the citie of London for my refuge, vpon hope to haue founde there ſome ſtay, was yet afterwards
<pb facs="tcp:10354:13"/> by reaſon of charges which grew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mine expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, forced to think of ſome other place. And thincking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly of the mater, to trauel ſtraight downe to my frends, both I thought it no way to be any greate eaſe, their dwelling being ſo far of: and alſo (as I wel conſidered) my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in that hote time of the plague, mighte ſeme neither void of danger nor ſuſpition. Therfore, for want of a better chifte, I concluded to retourne to Oxforde: nothing doubting by Goddes helpe, amongſt other which remained there as well as I, to prouide wel inoughe for meſelfe. But ſodainly not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my comming backe, (ſee I praye you, what matter I had of diſcorage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) my neighboure hard by me, fell ſicke of the Peſtilence. Here I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred one of <hi>Virgils</hi> verſes, who ſaythe in one of his Ecloges theſe wordes.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>VVhen fired is thy neighboures wall,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Surely thy daunger is not ſmall.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <pb facs="tcp:10354:14"/>
            <p>Therefore my minde gaue me, that it was nowe highe time for mee to ſtirre, and by and by (as the phraſe is) I remoued away ſpedily with bag &amp; baggage: not only content in this caſe, but alſo verye well apaide of a lodging ſomwhat ſimpler than mine other was. Thether therfore I fled, and there, as I mighte, I tooke my reſt. Anone after, woorde came vnto me, that my laundreſſe alſo, whiche waſhed my clothes, had her houſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in like manner. Wherewithall if I ſhoulde ſay, I was neuer a whitte moued, I dare ſay, I ſhoulde hardly be beleeued of a greate meinie. Howe muche more might I haue bene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, hearing the belles knolling both day and night, for ſuch as but the day before hadde bene mery, luſtie, and in good liking? yea and ſeing alſo daily and hourely whole houſholdes going with corpſes by my windowe ſide?</p>
            <p>But God alwayes be thanked, and
<pb facs="tcp:10354:14"/> praiſed for it, althoughe my bodye in deede was in ſome daunger: yet my minde natheleſſe was not much brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght out of quiete. Who as I ſoughte not deathe wilfully, which I ſtudied by all honeſt meanes to auoide: ſo yet notwithſtanding my delighte in the worlde was not ſo greate, but that hartily I could haue yeelded to Gods calling. In the meane time ſeeing it pleaſed God to deliuer me (as it wer) out of the Dragons mouthe: I thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght it my duty to embrace (as it wer) that light, whiche ſeemed more than halfe in darkeneſſe to be offered &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me, and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt thoſe euils, and great perils, wherewith I was then aſſailed, to ſee whether I coulde pike out any good.</p>
            <p>Whereuppon hauing aduiſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, I ſawe forthwith redy at mine elboe, pen, inke, and paper, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent furniture of bokes: thereto ſuche leaſure &amp; oportunitie was miniſtred
<pb facs="tcp:10354:15"/> vnto me on all ſides, that I could not poſſibly wiſhe greater. Breefely, my minde being at peace and reſt, there was nothing that mighte hinder me from well doing. Therefore, that I mighte not vtterly be vnthanckefull to almightye God, and at leaſte wiſe teſtifie my good meaning towardes his deare eſpouſe the congregation: I was fullye purpoſed with my ſelfe to bequeathe (as who ſaythe) to the broade worlde ſome poore token and monumente of my good will.</p>
            <p>And in this caſe, deare brother in our Sauioure Chriſte, I referre it verily to thine owne conſcience, whether with any thing more frutefully, my thought might haue ben holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, than euen with this paſſing worthy, moſt high and excellent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that, whiche can neuer be praiſed inoughe, I ſay, of Goddes endleſſe Prouidence. Whereof long before in a great meinie, and now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb facs="tcp:10354:15"/> in meſelfe ſuche great proofe, and experience was ſhewed vnto me, that I ſuppoſed I ſhuld do very euil, not to make other partakers of ſuche wholeſome leſſons, as thereby I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had then learned. From mine ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt trauelling wherin, althoughe I knewe I mighte be diſcouraged by reaſon of myne owne inſufficiencie: yet was I greatly comforted by the ſaying of a certaine wiſe man, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that <hi>in magnis voluiſſe ſat eſt,</hi> that is to ſay: in the enterpriſing of great things, it is enoughe to put forwarde a well willing purpoſe.</p>
            <p>What paines I haue taken, and what I haue broughte to paſſe, that mighte make for the furtheraunce of the chriſtian reader, that will I glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly referre to their iudgemente, that haue peruſed other wryters of the ſame matter. Who by ſuche diligente conference as ſhall be voide of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection
<pb facs="tcp:10354:16"/> and parcialitie, ſhall quickly perceyue without muche adoe, bothe what I haue added of mine own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreably to the doctrine of ſound religion: and with what choyſe and circumſpection I haue now and then borowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie of many other. Once this wil I boldly ſay, which I truſt vpon farther trial, ſhalbe openly &amp; manifeſtly proued true: Ther is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auouched in this whole work, of a ſingular and priuate iudgement, (which kinde of teaching, although I know it be plauſible in ytching eares, that take pleaſure in nouelties and ſtraunge things, yet of my part I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in it.) Yea I wil ſay farther, Ther is not one thing taught in this diſcourſe, not verie well concording with the receyued fayth of Chryſtes Churche, and verie conſonant to the rule of holy ſcrypture. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therfore I am wel aſſured, that any godly learned man will miſlyke.
<pb facs="tcp:10354:16"/> The godly learned man ſay I, and I pray thee reader, marke wel my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuperſtitious I deny not, wil in deede find great fault, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bicauſe they are the enimies of gods truth, I would be lothe to ſatiſfie in any wiſe. And this hitherto ſpeak I frely with good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lerning &amp; mater of this boke. Touching the fourm &amp; methode whych I haue vſed, I do the chriſtian Reader to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that in this my proceſſe I haue folowed that kind of order which the Rethoricians &amp; <hi>Melancthon</hi> namely, termeth by the name of Doctrinall. Therefore wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Gods Prouidence, bycauſe I would not haue men thynke that I ſpeake as <hi>Plato</hi> dyd of hys common weale, or <hi>Tullie</hi> of his perfit Orator, deſcribing that, which neither is, nor ſhal be: I declare firſt and formoſte that Gods Prouidence is not an idle and bare name of a thyng that is no wher to be had, but that which is,
<pb facs="tcp:10354:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath bene, and ſhalbe euer. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of make I open proofe in my two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bookes, alleaging in my firſte booke certaine groundes and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereuppon I builde this my doctrine: and replying in my ſeconde booke, againſte their fonde and vaine reaſons, which by all meanes poſſible woulde impugne it. In my thirde booke I procede to diſcloſe the nature of Gods Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, giuing thee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that it is not all one (as ſome ignorant think) either with Deſtinie or elſe Predeſtination, much leſſe with the naked preſcience, and for knowledge which ſome only wold aſcribe to Gods power. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence after I haue defined what it is, at large I bothe proue and handle in the ſame booke euery membre and clauſe of the definition. After this in my fourthe boke (ſo farre as I am led by holy ſcripture) I vtter the power of Gods gouernement: opening after
<pb facs="tcp:10354:17"/> what ſorte God ruleth the inferioure bodyes by the ſuperioure, the earthly by the heauenly, and the baſer by the excellenter, and ſuche as be of more perfection. And bicauſe this ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a meditation mighte ſeeme yet of little, or no effect, if we ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to ſome vſe: therfore the frutes and commodities that flow &amp; growe (as it were) out of the ſame, in ample manner be ſet oute.</p>
            <p>Nowe in proſecuting, and going throughe with all theſe things afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mencioned, from the beginning to the ende of my foure bokes, if it ſeeme to any man ſomewhat ſtraunge, that for the moſt part I reherſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimonies as wel of the ſcriptures, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> catholik fathers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, not in their owne language, wherin they wrote, but by way of tranſlation in our mother to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: It may pleaſe them to vnderſtande, that I conſidered I had to doe with two ſorts of men: with ſome, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
<pb facs="tcp:10354:18"/> are ignorant, &amp; know neither the Greeke nor Latine ſpeache, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe with other that haue good ſkill, and be profoundly learned in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bothe.</p>
            <p>Therefore, althoughe the incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of muche Greeke and Latine, might peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture haue made a good ſhowe, and very well haue ſerued for the enlarging, and amplifying of my diſcourſe: yet the vnſkilfull, I knewe well inoughe, coulde haue ſlender for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance by ſuche meanes, to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it was alwayes free to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and refuge to thoſe authors, as well Greekes as Latines, whiche by me there are recited. By conference of whome they ſhall well perceiue and finde oute, howe faithfully I haue dealt in my tranſlation.</p>
            <p>It remaineth nowe, Chriſtian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thou catche not vnto thee with the lefte hande, that whiche
<pb facs="tcp:10354:18"/> is raughte oute with the righte: I ſay, that in no wiſe thou be ouer-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie to miſconſtrue me in anye thing, that I wryte, but ſyncerely interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate my doings.</p>
            <p>If there be any thing, which ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not well in thine eares at the firſt hearing: yet doe not buſilye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne that, whiche thou conceiueſt not by and by. Before thou giue oute thy verdict, and proceede to thy rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cenſure, I pray thee be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men ſee not alwayes vpon the ſodaine: but no mannes eyes are more bli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theirs which malice hath put out. If my ſhoe tread not always ſtreighte, I forbidde not a brotherly admonition, which is voide of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and biting gall: for the which I ſhall heartily giue thee thankes. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I require of thee, that thou depraue me not behinde my backe.</p>
            <p>This I wryte, muche miſdoubting
<pb facs="tcp:10354:19"/> the olde croked practiſe of ſome crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>Zoilus.</hi> Whoſe manner is, rather of enuie to be nipping at other mens good endeuoures, than of any charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and godly zeale, himſelfe to do any thing for common profite. But lette him ſay what he liſt, it ſhall not ſkill. For as in publiſhing of this my work I ſought not gredily the praiſe of the worlde, whiche by the like doing I mighte haue hunted for, not a fewe yeres agoe, hauing a booke redy pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the printe in the latine tong: ſo neither do I care a whit for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious diſpraiſing of any ill diſpoſed, enuious, or vaine glorious perſon: let him plaie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Momus,</hi> or the <hi>Mimus,</hi> with neuer ſo craftie a pretence, yea or elſe diſguiſe himſelfe how he will. Whom moreouer fully I woulde haue aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, that I weighe more the honeſt teſtimony of three or foure godly and learned men, whoſe ſincerity of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is well knowne: than the cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:10354:19"/> of an hundred vngracious tongs. Yea, &amp; were it ſo (as I dare ſay of the contrary I might aſſure meſelf) that I ſhoulde finde either none, or verie fewe, who in a lawfull quarell would vphold my cauſe: yet I ſet more by the witneſſe of a good conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, than any ill will, or frendſhip to be had in the worlde. Farewell in Chriſt.</p>

And the lyuer in déede hath the purer parte: as for the groſſe reliques of it remayning, bicauſe they are not fitte for noriſhment, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth them downe to the entrayles. To be ſhorte, there is no member of the whole body, which therby receaueth not bothe conforte and conueniente ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce.</p>
               <p>And were it ſo, that oure weake ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities coulde not throughly reache to the vnderſtanding of the curious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhyppe of oure bodies: yet ſurely this conſideration ſhoulde ſtirre vs vp to the prayſe of God, that he hathe not onely garnyſhed vs wyth a certayne quicke liuelyneſſe of the mynde, but therewithall hath giuen vs ſuch a ſhape, as to mannes nature and diſpoſition mighte ſéeme moſte aunſwerable and correſpondente. For whereas naturally other liuing creatures bée ſo formed and compacte togither, that they bée alwayes poring vpon the ground: man onely God hath made bolte vprighte, with his face looking vppe to heauenwarde, as to the chiefe houſe of his progenie, that his eyes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10354:43"/> and whole heart béeing faſte fixed vpon it, he mighte the rather be induced to knowe God.</p>
               <p>Therefore in his vpper parte he hath placed his head, lyke an highe caſtle of defence, and in the ſame hath he ſet his brayne, as a iewell and treaſure of great pryce. For looke howe the ſallet is a ſafegarde to the ſouldiers heade, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the ſcull kéepeth in the brayne, and ſaueth it from the force of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Agaynſt the which, leaſt the brayne lighting ouer ſore, ſhoulde take ſome harme, God almightie hath compaſſed it with two ſkinnes, called of the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <hi>meningas, i.</hi> the reſmes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one of them béeing thin and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not only goeth rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about the whole brayne, but alſo hath paſſage betwixt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe turning wayes, which are ſéene to be in the ſaide brayne. The other béeing thicker and more ſubſtantial, is therfore ſet betwixt the brayne, and the brayne panne, leaſt the brayne béeing tender, ſhould take hurte and damage by the hardneſſe of the ſcull. Wherefore the braine (as I ſaid before) in the head, as it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10354:43"/> were in a highe tower is conſerued and kept like a great treaſure.</p>
               <p>And wheras he that hath charge ouer a gariſon, hath néede of ſpies and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to foreſée miſchiefes to come, aſwel in peace, as in warre: neither is mans reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding, béeing the very captayne and guyde of the body, lefte helpleſſe and deſtitute of theſe. For God hath placed in the foreſayde towre, two eyes, as it were, two watchmen to looke round about them where they will, ſo quicke and voluble of their nature, that they can quickely with a little rolling turne aſide from any thing that is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The noſe adioyning therevnto ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſtande beneathe lyke a wall, that is directly placed betwixte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both. The eye liddes that couer the eyes, bée made vndoubtedly as fit as can be, bothe to open and cloſe agayne, as cauſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. And they be trenched about (as it were) with the eye bries, by meanes whereof, whether they be open or faſte ſhut, if any mote or droppe of moyſture ſhould fall vpon them, it might be eaſily repelled and kept off.</p>

               <p>The eares and the noſethrilles, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the one of them heareth a ſounde, the nature whereof is to goe vpwards, the other of them ſmelleth and taſteth odoures, whiche lykewiſe vapoure vp a lofte: They are bothe of them very fitly placed, bothe in the higher parte of the body, and nexte the brayne.

The brute beaſtes are armed euery one with a certayne natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall defence, the buls with their hornes, the Beares with their téeth, the Lyons with tearing and deuouring, the beaſt called <hi>Bonaſus</hi> with his dongue caſting, the Cuttle fiſhe with an incke that he flinges about him, ſome with flying, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with hiding of them ſelues, all one way or other can ſafegarde themſelues.

               <p>With theſe and other the like words, theſe Epicures dilate mannes miſery, affirming that nature to mankinde is a ſtepdame rather than any mother. Not vntruely in déede altogether, if the marke they ſhot at, were not open blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie againſt God: but their concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vtterly is to be deteſted. For what if God haue not geuen a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great clawes, and talantes, nor couered him with an héerie ſkinne, like a beare? which as they were nothing ſéemely for ſo gentle and milde a creature: ſo neither were they commodious for mannes vſe.

               <p>Man hathe no ſcales lyke a Dragon, wherby he may beare off a cruel blowe: But he hath arte, and pollycie lodged in his tender brayne, whereby hée was not onely able to inuent complet harnis for hys bodie, but all engynnes and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of warfare, yea, not onely al en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and inſtrumentes of warfare, but whatſoeuer elſe you coulde imagine ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profitable, or pleaſaunt for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde.</p>

Whereof that ye may the better vnderſtand the whole ſtory, I will ſet it out, and declare it the more at large. When the good olde man father Abraham, béeing now at the laſte caſte, perceaued he drue towardes his graue (for age is a preamble to deathe) he charged his ſeruaunt to procure a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for his ſon Iſaac, &amp; that not out of the number of the Cananites, amongſt whom at that time he led his life, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oute of the race of his aunceſtors.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10354:64"/> Which alſo he ſhoulde do vpon an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red confidence in Gods promiſes, which he helde for certayne, and out of doubte. And to the intent he ſhould not faile him in ſo waightie a caſe, he cauſed him for his better aſſuraunce to take an othe.</p>
               <p>Vpon this the ſeruaunt, moſt worthy of credite and eſtimation for his faythful and good behauiour, well waying and conſidering his maiſters words, vpon a conſcience that he had to perfourme hys faythed and ſworne loyaltie, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of that eye which ſéeth what euery body dothe, and with what carefulneſſe and true feare of God he is faythfull in the accompliſhing of his affayres: firſt he moueth this queſtion, whether he mighte bring Iſaac his maſters ſonne ſonne backe againe into his natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the mayde affiaunced refuſing to take any long iourney. But when Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham could not abide to heare of this, ſtill charging &amp; commaunding him in playne wordes, not in any wiſe to conuey hys ſonne homewarde where he was borne, but to followe that which he was called to, not doubting of Gods aſſiſtaunce in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10354:64"/> ſo godly an enterpriſe as that was: he tooke leaue of his maſter, and all his houſholde, and after he had trauayled a long voyage, at the laſte he came into <hi>Chartas,</hi> a citie of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where he ſetteth his Camels to reſſe in the ſhade, to the intent he might eaſe them of their labour.</p>
               <p>In the meane time wel remembring his maſters leſſon, and knowing that his good ſucceſſe depended wholly on Gods Prouidence: what did he? O worthy example, and méete of all Chriſtians to be followed. Hée wente not (as ſome woulde haue done) to conſulte with wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſardes, neither did he ſéeke helpe of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, or fledde for his refuge to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunters, no nor yet aſked he any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle at what houre he mighte come to haue his purpoſe. All theſe things verily and ſuch like, he either eſtemed as méere vanities, or elſe deteſted alſo as vngodly meanes. But what did he? falling downe vppon his knées before God, O Lorde (ſayth he) the God of my maſter Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, proſper (I beſéeche thée) mine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that this day I haue vndertaken,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10354:65"/> and extende thy goodneſſe towardes my maiſter. Beholde I ſtande héere before this well, and the damoſels of this citie come foorth to drawe water.

               <p>Thus loe he behaued himſelfe, I ſay, this godly ſeruaunt of the Patriarke A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and in this maner he procéeded in his ſute. Wherfore who could not iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly maruell at the ſingular good zeale of this worthy man? Or who could prayſe (as it deſerueth) euery clauſe &amp; particle of his prayer, wherein fayth and wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as it were goodly dyamonds, be ſo apparaunt? for that he not paſſing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon other things, dependeth onely vpon god, and in him repoſeth his whole hope, that ſurely is to be aſcribed to his great

And wheras he is perſuaded of his maſters God, that he is a generall ſanctuarie for all men that will flée vnto him for ſuccour, and aſketh and wayteth at his hande for an happie concluſion of his voyage, that eteraynely is a ſigne and token of an excellent &amp; paſſing good fayth.</p>
               <p>What was therefore his rewarde? with what ſucceſſe went he forwarde or in his matter that he wente about? For it is a worthy thing doubtleſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, howe graciouſly they are thought vppon that feare God. Hée hadde all his will at the firſt aſking: for before his prayer was fully ended (ſée the ſtraunge caſe) foorthe of the citie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Rebecca, not glyſtering (I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte youe) with any brayded haire, nor trymly garnyſhed wyth Golde: but (as it became a vertuous and godly mayde) very ſoberly, decent and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with hir earthen veſſell that ſhée car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about hir vpon hir ſhoulder, a very beautifull damoſel to looke to, and therto

Yea moreouer whyles the ſeruaunte, béeing thirſtie, dranke a good draught, I will draw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (quod the Damſell) for the camels too, that they alſo may be ſatiſfied. Could any thing chance more luckely, or more according to his deſire?</p>
               <p>Therefore when the ſeruaunt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards had reported in order what had happened to <hi>Bethuel</hi> the maydens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to hir brother <hi>Laban,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great wondring, they ſodenly brake out into thoſe words: This thing is the Lordes owne doing, and we can not ſay agaynſt thée, good nor bad. Loe Rebecca is preſent before thy face, take hir to thee, and goe away with hir, and let hir

               <p>But what ſhall we nowe ſay to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph? Alas poore man, I pitie him to ſée how miſerably he was toſſed.

And what did their hautie ſtomackes leaue vndone to preuente him (ſhall I ſaye) of hys dreame? Nay, God him ſelfe rather, if it mighte haue bene? Their reuerende hoare headed father, vnto whom Ioſeph

               <p>O blinde and beaſtly bolde enuy, that forgetteth nature, and forſaketh all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, whither carryeſt thou menne headlong to thy bottomleſſe pitte of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe? For firſt they would haue made him oute of the way by defiling their hands with this guyltleſſe bloud. Which cruell counſayls of theirs, if it mighte haue taken place, then in déede (Ioſeph béeing ſo diſpatched of his auiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) it could not otherwiſe haue bene choſen, but that néedes they muſt haue had their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But howe true is the ſaying of the wiſe Salomon: <hi>In vayne is wiſdome.

               <p>With what face therefore, or wyth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10354:72"/> what countenaunce could I looke vppon ſo gracious a ſoueraigne Lorde, if with my diligent and faithful ſeruice I ſhould not trauaile to requite his kindeneſſe. For without doubte, vnthanckefulneſſe is moſte worthy of all men to be hated, and lothed euen with deteſtation, being not onely one of the greateſt vices in the worlde, but the very mother alſo of all other vices beſides. For notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that euery vniuſt prancke is very great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earneſtly to be eſchued, yet neuer from that bottomeleſſe infernall lake came a more peſtilente and pernicious furie, than is this vice of ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes ſuch as haue well deſerued. Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore my liege Lorde, that hath done already ſo much for me, hath ſuche a confidence in mine honeſt and vpright dealing, that he hath deliuered vppe all his ſubſtaunce from his owne hand into mine. It is not my parte in ſtéede of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding and ſafe kéeping his treaſure committed to my charge, to become a théefe, and a falſe harlot, and to lay hand on thoſe things, which I haue nothing to doe with.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10354:73"/> For I muſte not doe as Adam my firſte father did, who, hauing all other frute in Paradiſe at his commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, raught his hand to that trée which he ſhould not haue medled with at all, and ſo for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful coueting of one trée, loſt the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>No doubte theſe and ſuche like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did Ioſephe putte into the Quéenes minde, and God ſo helde his hande ouer him, that in nothing that he did, he was to ſéeke: Soone after ſéeing ſhee could not ſpéede, ſhée eſpied out hir wiſhed oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and when other were farre inough out of the way, catching faſte hold of his cloke, ſhée cried out mainly with a loude voice. But he fléeing her force, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his eares at hir perſuaſions, when he had run away with his cloke behinde him, and walked vp and downe bare of his olde apparell, but yet clad with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſinceritie, and not naked of honeſt conuerſation. (For he bluſhed not, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam did after the breache of Gods lawe, but he was ſo affected in his minde, as our firſt parentes were before their fall, whome the nakedneſſe of their bodyes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10354:73"/> made not to be abaſhed). Then this wily madame, as one that was hir craftes maiſtreſſe, incenſeth the king hir huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againſt his loyall and faithful ſeruaunt, &amp; ſticketh not, with a ſhameleſſe mouth, to call him a betrayer of chaſt life, which was a chéefe defender of that vertue. And although Ioſeph without any great adoe could quickly confute ſuch an open ſlaunder, yet he hadde rather holde his peace, and quietly put vp an iniurie, than reuele the trecherie of his maſtreſſe, and publiſhe hir diſordred appetites, to the worlde. Therefore withoute any cauſe knowne why, neither hearing before of the quareile that was brought againſte him, nor being ſuffred in the iudgement hal to ſay any thing in his owne defenſe, he was fettred and caſt into a déepe dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where (God wotteth) he had but a ſory lodging, and endured full many a rough ſtorme. O rufull and harde caſe: What woulde many a one haue done in the like taking? Surely they wold haue boaſted their innocencie, they woulde haue bragged of their faithfull ſeruice, they would haue ratteled their accuſer,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10354:74"/> they woulde lamentably haue complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of their owne ſtate, yea what would they not haue done? I thinke verily they wold haue murmured againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. None of all this dothe Ioſeph: but meekely and mildely like a lambe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaneth him ſelfe in all reſpectes.</p>
               <p>And perchance thus he reaſoned with himſelf, calling ſecretely to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, howe muche God had done for him in times paſt: I wiſſe long before this time I haue bene as daungerouſly beſet, as I am now, and yet (God be thanked) the ſnare was broken: God gaue me fauor in their eyes, at whoſe handes I coulde leaſt loke for any ſuche thing. And nowe who knoweth, why I fall into this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? It may be, God wold haue my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience to be yet further aſſayed: And bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man is perfite, that is of fleſhe and bone, it is poſſible alſo God wil cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten me to make me the better to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: And what if alſo it pleaſe God to vſe this as a way for my preferment? I knowe not in déede perfitely howe the matter ſtandeth, eſpecially when I aſke counſell of fleſhe and bloude: But ſure
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10354:74"/> I am of this, that God is iuſte, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wil not ſuffer me to take wrong: I doubt not neither, but that as he hathe hitherto preſerued me farre beyonde all mennes expectation: ſo he will continue his louing kindneſſe, and ſtill be my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and good Lord. In the meane time ſo long as I doe mine endeuoure to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue and followe my vocation, I wil both hope well, and hold my peace, humbling my ſelfe alwayes (as it becommeth me) vnder his mightie hand. Neither will I ſtudie to treade in their malitious ſteps, that ſo buſily haue bente them ſelues to woorke me woe, by ſéeking any meanes to be reuenged. But rather kiſſe the rod with ſubmiſſion, wherwith I am ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Gods hande. So doing, be it ſo he haue conceyued any diſpleaſure, he will fling away againe the rodde of hys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and beholde me with a more amiable and chéerefull countenaunce, than euer before he was accuſtomed. Well in déede mighte Ioſephe thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue with him ſelfe, and very like it is that he did ſo.</p>

               <p>Wherein the ſequele that followed, declared how litle he was deceiued.

The king that hearde his wiſe counſaile, perceiuing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde and déepe witte, reioyced muche at his ſo well gouerned demeanor, but eſpecially to ſée in ſo tender and gréene youthly yéeres ſuche ripe and grounded diſcretion.

               <p>Héereof it commeth that God is ſaide in the ſeriptures, to ſtrike wicked men blinde, to harden their heartes, to ſeduce the prophets, and ſend men the ſpirite of error, that they may beléeue lies, and ſo forthe.</p>

               <p>To make the matter more playne, I pray you, was not Gods deliuering of his ſonne Chryſt to the Iewes, by the hand of Iudas, as his inſtrument, a good déede? it was ſo queſtionleſſe: for it was doone for the ſaluation of the faythfull. Yet it was not good, as it came of Iudas, who partely carryed away with hatred, partely blinded with auarice, betrayed his maiſter.</p>
               <p>After the ſame maner it may be ſayd of the hangman that executeth a fellon
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10354:97"/> at the commaundemente of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. The dooing whereof may haue two originalles, eyther the magiſtrate, whoſe inſtrument the hangman is, and ſo this execution of the fellon is good, or elſe the hangman that doeth that which he is about, with an inwarde mouing of his owne, wherby he alſo is the cauſe of the felons death, whom he executeth. If the hangman therfore put this felone to death for the better maintenance of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the execution is good, and deſerueth commendation: but if he be ſtirred vp to the ſlaughter of him with hatred (bicauſe peraduenture he was his enimie, whom he is about to diſpatche out of the way) then can he not choſe before God, but he muſt nedes be gyltie of his death. So we ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the ſame worke, as it may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in two ſeuerall reſpects, is bothe a good worke, and it is faultie alſo: and one way to be done laudably, an other way with blame and ſhame inoughe. Euen ſo wée ſay of God, who althoughe hée worke all thinges willingly, whyche be done in the worlde: yet dothe he not all thinges with the ſame mynde, as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10354:98"/> peraduenture do ſome of his inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, by whom he worketh: neither willeth them to be done with the ſame intente, which maketh Gods works to be prayſe worthy, mans doinges oftentimes to be nothing ſo.

               <p>By this it appeareth howe vaine and fooliſhe their talke is, that come in with ſuche fonde obiections: If a théefe be the miniſter of Gods will, why finde wée faulte with him? if a murtherer execute Gods iudgements, why is he not rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? for truely the aunſwere is ſoone made.

Whoſe will and pleaſure if they had ſo greatly deſired to ſatiſfie: why followed they rather that their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and deſperate inclination, than Gods will reueled in his worde?</p>
               <p>Hereby alſo we may learne what to aunſwere them, which will obiect Gods hatred agaynſt ſinne, and ſuche as be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with a naughtie life, ſaying: If God ſtirre vp ſinners to doo euill, and make them veſſels of reproche: howe can he hate them or their ſinnes, and not rather loue them, and make muche of them?

                  <hi>God of the number of the wicked, whom he doth not iuſtifie, maketh veſſelles ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to reproche, he hateth not in them that which he made: for asfarfoorthe as they be wicked, they be odible in hys ſighte. But as farfoorth as they be veſſels, they be made to ſome vſe, that by the punishement that is ordeyned for them, the veſſelles which be made to honoure, may take profite. Therefore God hateth not the veſſels of reproch, neither as they be men, nor as they be veſſels. That is to ſay, neither that which he made in them by creating, nor that which he dothe in them by ordayning. For he hateth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe things that he made. But yet that he maketh them veſsels of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he dothe it for this vſe, that other may be corrected. For he hateth wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse in them, which was not of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And as a Iudge hateth thefte in a man, but he hateth not his punishment, that he is condemned to a minepitte to digge for metall: for the thefte was of the theeues dooing, the punishement the Iudges appoynting: So God, whereas he maketh veſsels of perdition of the dough</hi>

                  <hi>of the wicked, he hateth not that whiche he maketh, that is to ſay, the worke of his caſting them away, that perish in ſuch paynes as are due vnto them, whereby ſuche as he hath mercy vppon, finde oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion miniſtred vnto them of ſaluation. So it was ſayde to Pharao: For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe haue I ſtyrred thee vp, that I may shevve my povver vppon thee, and that my name mighte be ſpoken of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the earth.

               <p>Vnnaturall therefore, and vngodly was the dealing of Ioſephs brethren,

A good magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate will kill none of his citizens, the preſeruation of whome he knoweth is committed to his charge.

               <p>Be it ſpoken, that we haue ſayde for example ſake, not to ſignifie, that God is vrged to doe any thing in like manner, who hath all his creatures at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and moſt fréely dealeth in all things that he taketh in hand: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhewe and make it manifeſt, that for theſe and thoſe conſiderations which may moue vs, or not moue vs, as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſerue vs to or fro, we may once, and at one preſent time bothe will and not will the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Which as I haue examplified it of our ſelues, ſo truely and very agréeably to the ſcriptures, the ſame may alſo be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to God. Forbiddeth he not (I pray you) in his ten commaundements, that any manſlaughter or murder ſhould be committed? And yet it is written of Elie <note place="margin">1.

And doth not god condemne in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracies that be made to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10354:105"/> the innocent? And yet would he haue Ioſephe ſolde by the falſe traine of his brethren, that by that occaſion hée might come to Egypt. Whiche Ioſephe himſelfe alſo witneſſeth, ſpeaking to his brethren with theſe woordes, Geneſ. 45. <hi>It is not ye, but God that ſent me before yee, to the intent I mighte bee a ſtaie to you in the time of the dearth.</hi> Doeth he not condemne adulterers in like maner, and committers of abhominable and wicked inceſt? yet would he with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt of Abſolon, that defiled himſelf with his fathers wiues, puniſhe the adulterie of King Dauid being his father. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſayeth God his owne ſelfe. 2.

Which Iob con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with hymſelfe, putteth all vppe mildely and quietly, ſaying: <hi>The Lorde gaue mee, and the Lorde hathe taken from me againe: Bleſſed be the name of the Lorde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherby we may eaſily gather, how true the ſaying of <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> is, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that many things be done againſt Gods will, which neuertheleſſe be not done beſides his will. Againſte Goddes wyll bée trayterous and deceytefull traines, wherby the innocent is entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: againſt Gods wil, is the enticing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of a mannes ſonne or daughter,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10354:106"/> or any ſeruaunt to him belonging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent of the partie that hath iuſte title and right vnto them: againſt Gods will is inceſt, and taking away of other mennes goodes: and yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> all this is not done w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out gods wil, of Iacobs children, of Abſalon, of the Sabeans. &amp;c. it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the woords of the holy ſcripture.</p>
               <p>And this is the very ſame diſtinction, that others alſo haue taught, ſaying that Gods wil is vnderſtand after two ſorts, ſometimes of thoſe things whiche God ſimply aloweth, ſomtime of thoſe things which he liketh not ſimply and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but onely that it pleaſeth him to vſe them to ſome certaine ende. In the firſt ſenſe we ſay, that god willeth thoſe things whych he commaundeth in his lawe, &amp; that he willeth not thoſe things which be forbidden by his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And of this will Chriſte ſpake, when he ſaid, <hi>Not al that ſay Lord Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that dothe the vvill of my father vvhich is in heauen.</hi> And in that meaning we ſay in our Lordes prayer, <hi>Thy vvill be done in earth as it is in heauen.</hi> This
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10354:106"/> will amongſte the ſchoolemen, is called <hi>

In the ſeconde ſenſe, we ſay God willeth many things which he forbiddeth, not that he liketh them for any thing that is in them: but ſo farre forth as by them he either putteth good men to their triall, whom it liketh him to chaſten, or elſe is reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of ſinners, by giuing them ouer from one ſinne, to fall headlong into an other. Therefore he ſtirred vp ſome of the Paleſtines to kill Elie his children. For they wer not ruled by their fathers counſell, bicauſe the Lorde was willing to kill them. 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Notable is that figured repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Iob, of the talke that is imagined betwixte God and Sathan: who aſketh God leaue to afflicte Iob. By the which we may ſée, that bothe Iob was diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Deuill, that deſired to vndoe him, and of the Sabeans, and the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, that were gréedye of their pray: But yet not without the wil of God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome Iob aſcribeth the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhe and calamitie that was broughte
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10354:107"/> vpon him, ſaying: <hi>The Lord gaue, and the Lorde tooke avvay.</hi> The ende therefore that God reſpected in making hym a pray for theeues, was to putte him to the exerciſe of his pacience. The ende of Goddes purpoſe in Abſalons inceſtuous acte, was to puniſhe the adultery of his father Dauid, in the conueying away of Ioſephe by his brethren, to ſende him before into Egypte, that in the time of the great dearthe, he mighte prouide for his father and all his houſholde. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neither the ſtealing away of Ioſeph, nor Abſalons inceſt, nor the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and rauening of the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> that God aloweth, as they be the breache of his lawe, the diſturbing of a fellowſhippe, and ſocietie amongſte men, and the hindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of loue, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of one man with an other, but as by them he executeth his purpoſed determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, either in being reuenged of the wicked, or in exerciſing the pacience of the elect, in keeping them in modeſt and humble behauior in their affliction, and in making them to continue ſtedfaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all aſſaults, euen like ſtout cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10354:107"/> vnto the end. Theſe be thoſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous counſelles of almightie God, whereby oute of darckeneſſe he fetcheth light, &amp; (as it were) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt thornes maketh Roſes to ſpring forth: this is the wonderful coupling togither of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and almighty power, that maketh him to ſuffer nothing to be euill done, whiche he dothe not conuerte to a good ende, as before we haue declared oute of <hi>Auſtine.</hi>

               <p>Theſe therefore, and the like places may be quickely anſwered, <hi>Thou art not a God that vvilleth iniquitie.</hi> And <hi>God hateth vvicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and their vvickedneſſe alike.</hi> For true it is in déede, that he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not the iniquitie it ſelf, or rather (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> woord of the Pſalme mighte be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated) he deliteth not in it: nay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (that more is) he hateth not it onely, but him that doeth it. And whie? for ſo farre forth as he maketh himſelfe ougly with this deformitie of ſinne, he ſtudieth to blotte Goddes image out of his heart, wherein he was created in true holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and rightuouſneſſe, and to printe in himſelfe the Deuilles ſhape. Whiche
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10354:108"/> in Gods ſight ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not chuſe, but be a hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing.</p>
               <p>And yet that he permitteth bothe <note place="margin">An idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion may not be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God.</note> ſinne and ſinnefull men, ſhall we ſay it is againſt his wil? No truely, ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as it openly fighteth with Gods Prouidence, ſo doth it manifeſt violence to Gods worde.

Therfore Dauid calleth his aduerſaries the ſworde and hande of the Lord in the 13. and. 14. verſe of the. 17. Pſalme.

For the ſame reaſon the king of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonians is compared to an axe and a ſawe, in the very ſame tenth chapiter of Eſay before mencioned: and in the. 27.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10354:108"/> God any ſuche kinde of ſeruice, as the godly that ſubmit themſelues to Gods will reueled in the ſcriptures: but that God ſo ordereth their malice, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares they execute Gods decréed will and pleaſure from euerlaſting. And this wil is it, that is termed of the ſchoolemen <hi>voluntas bene placiti.</hi> Whereof ſayeth Mardocheus in the thirtienth Chapiter of the booke of Eſther, that there is no man able to reſiſt it.</p>
               <p>I omit diuers wordes in the Bible, of ſeducing, blinding, deceiuing, ſending ſtrong illuſions, giuing men ouer to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If it be your deſtinie to recouer, you haue no nede of the Phyſition: if it be not your deſtinie, the Phyſition can helpe you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

               <p>But very reaſon mighte ſuffiſe for a confirmation. For ſéeing Prouidence is the wil of God, by the which (as <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> wryteth) all things in the world be gouerned in conuenient order: and Gods

The ſeconde cauſes in déede being diuers, no maruell though they hinder themſelues nowe and then: but Goddes wil can not be letted by any manner of conſtrainte.</p>
               <p>Here peraduenture wil you ſay: God once liked well inoughe of the Iewiſhe <note place="margin">Anſvver.</note> ceremonies: yet afterwardes it pleaſed him to diſanull them. Howe can you ſay then, that Gods Prouidence is not mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table?</p>
               <p>I anſwere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God in déede is alwayes <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> of one minde, but neuertheleſſe that he alwayes forſawe by his wiſedome, that all things were not agréeable for all times &amp; ſeaſons. <hi>S.

And ſor a further example he bringeth in one <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditianus</hi> a Phyſition, who with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine medicine healed a ſickemanne:

Herevpon <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus,</hi> when he had quietly hearoe him oute his tale, very ſoberly making him anſwer, as not muche amoued with his talke: No maruel ſyr (quoth he) for I did not miniſter it.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:10354:172"/> ſo many wayes. Vntill ſuche time therfore as Chriſte came, the very body of all thoſe ſhadowes that went before, and eſpecially vntill ſuch time, as he had made vpon the croſſe a <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummatum est:</hi> with his owne onely oblation, making perfite for euer them that are ſanctified: ſtoode all the rites of the Iewes in full force, as it were handwrytings of oure ſinnes not taken away. Which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde being cancelled by the deathe of Chriſt, the true Paſchal Lambe, whoſe bloude remoued from vs the wrathe of God, and tooke away the ſinnes of the worlde: howe coulde they continue any longer, withoute manifeſt preiudice and derogation to our Lord and ſauioure Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte? God then is not a whit the more vnconſtante for any thing that is obiected yet.</p>
               <p>Whoſe Prouidence to proue varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vncertain, is there yet any more left behinde? Yes marie (will they ſay) there be ſundry places in the ſcripture to that effecte, as namely touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites, and the good king Ezechias.</p>
               <p>But ſurely to him that will examine
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:10354:172"/> circumſtances, it ſhall wel appeare, that God when he decréeth any thing to be done, dothe ioyntly alſo at the ſame time appoynt bothe the very inſtant at what time and hour it ſhould be, and alſo how long it ſhould continue &amp; hold on. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas God commaunded Ionas to preache deſtruction to the Niniuites for their offenſes, &amp; afterwardes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime their pardone, being conuerted from their euill wayes: what elſe would he meane by that, but that at the firſte their ſinnes were ſo great, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued a downefall, and an ouerthrowe? And that afterwards their amendement was ſo acceptable and welcome to him, that he thoughte them woorthy of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? So that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Niniuites being changed, Gods will was altered neuerthemore, who wel forſaw in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both their naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty life and their conuerſion. Wherunto to bring them by repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he ordained Ionas his preaching to be a meane, that occaſion might not be giuen him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The ſame may be ſaide of king Ezechias, to whom being ſore ſick, God bad that he ſhoulde haue warning of his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:10354:173"/> deathe. And yet when he had prayed to him, after he prolonged his life for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares. Did not God ſignifie by this, that the diſeaſe, with the which the king was touched, coulde not be remedied by mannes helpe, but yet might be reléeued by God, who commonly in ſuch a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate caſe is woonte moſte effectually to ſhewe his power? And came not this to paſſe by Gods owne will, who diſpoſeth things in their order, and giueth them that ſucceſſe that it pleaſeth him?</p>
               <p>For what néede I to ſay as ſome doe, that God, when he threatneth eyther deathe or any ſuche puniſhment due for ſinne, hathe a condicion, which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth, that is to ſay, their amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reformation whom he ſo fray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? For ſure we are of this, whatſoeuer is done by the preacher, as Goddes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtrument, wherby he woorketh, whether it be by threatning or fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes in the behalfe of God, whiles he procedeth according to Goddes reueled will in holy ſcripture: yet God hath his ſecrete iudgementes, and a iuſt manner of dealing, which mannes meaſured ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:10354:173"/> can not reache.</p>
               <p>Nay (ſay they againe) you muſte not eſcape vs ſo. For the woords of ſcripture be a great deale more plaine, aſcribing vnto God repentaunce of his former déedes, which without chaunge of hys minde coulde not be.</p>
               <p>In déede that ſuch a manner of ſpeach is in ſcripture I deny not (for we reade that God repented him of the creation of man, of making Saule king, &amp; of diuers other ſuche like things) but howe will they proue therfore, that God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence is mutable? For as repentance ſéemeth to be attributed to God, ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, zele, and indignation, with other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine affections be likewiſe giuen to him in the Bible. Is God therefore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to any paſſions? Can he be inflamed with any choler, or any heat, procéeding of our groſſe humors? Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he repent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of any thing, from whome nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be hid, either paſt, preſent, or to come? Nay, let that be holden for a certaintie, whiche Samuel ſpake afterwardes to king Saule: <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael vvill</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But how then ſhall we reconcile the words of the ſcripture: Out of doubt god ſpeaking to vs men, beareth very muche with our childiſhe weakneſſe, and to the entent we might the better vnderſtande him, it pleaſeth him of his goodneſſe to liſpe and ſtammer with vs as it were.

As farforth then as any effecte or deede done, eſcapeth the order of ſome particuler cauſe, we may ſay, it was caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and came by lotte, in reſpecte (I ſay) of the cauſe particular: but in reſpecte of the cauſe vniuerſall, from whoſe order

But yet in the order of our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, we will not in all reſpects follow the trade of the Iewes, but we wil do as that ſpirit doth guyde vs, wherby Chriſt ruleth the congregation. Admit they be ceremoniall in ſome ſorte, yet doubtleſſe abſolutely they be not. For the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Sabboth was not onely ordeyned for this ende, that it might be a figure of that ſpirituall reſt afore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but there be two cauſes beſide.</p>
               <p>The one was, that there mighte be a daye aſſigned, wherein the people mighte come togither to heare the lawe, and to do other dueties there requiſite of Gods ſeruaunts.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:10354:200"/>
               <p>The other was, that ſeruaunts liuing vnder the obedience of their maſters, might haue a vacant time from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for their honeſt &amp; godly recreation.</p>
               <p>Therefore figuratiuely and Iudaical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we wil no more obſerue the Sabboth day: yet of euery ſeuen dayes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weke wil we picke out one for our aſſemblies, wherin we will méete togither to heare Gods worde, to ioyne in hartie prayer to almightie God, and to receaue the holy Sacraments, according to our Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Yea and we will cauſe our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts &amp; whole familie to do the ſame. All this is morall, and appertayneth to our ciuill dutie. In reſpecte wherof, we ſhould not without muche impietie, let it ſlippe.</p>
               <p>That which I ſpeake concerning the <note place="margin">The lavve of keeping the Sabboth, and obſeruing the tithes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note> Sabboth, might be ſayd in like maner of the tenthes, which were giuen in the old lawe. For as they ſignified oure imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the ſupplying whereof they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for by the comming of our Lord and Sauiour Chryſte: we will not meddle nor deale with them in any wyſe. But ſurely yet there be other cauſes,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:10354:201"/> wherfore they were bothe admitted by decrées and counſayles at the firſte, and we that come nowe in this latter age coulde not without greate diſorder (yea I mighte ſay alſo, greate wante of a due and ſober conſideration) of our own priuate authoritie, caſte them off.

And the very chéefe mayntenaunce of them, who (as S. Paul ſayth) were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with the altar, I pray you, what was it? Tithes I trowe. Tithes therfore ſay I, by the very rule of S.

               <p>This ſeemeth to be the purporte and meaning of Chryſtes woordes, and the <note place="margin">Theſe fat idle belhed ſvvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n ſhe Prelates are touched.</note> very naturall ſenſe of this place: noleſſe touching (in my iudgement) theſe fatte idell bellied ſwyniſhe Prelates of oure time, than it did the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies at that time, when Chriſt liued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon the earthe.

But this by the way.</p>
               <p>Chriſt then doth not condemne tithes (as ſome would ſay) but alloweth them, nor denyeth them, but approueth them, nor taketh them away, but eſtabliſheth them.

               <p>But as for ſuche authors let vs way them hardly as lighte as any man ſhall thinke good. Surely that place of the Actes is not in my ſimple iudgement ſo lightly of any man to be eſteemed. For when Peter (ſayth Luke) who had bene <note place="margin">Actes 12</note> conducted by the Angel out of priſon, had knocked at the gates of that houſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the brethren were met togither, they that were there aſſembled hearing of it, when it could not once ſinke into their heades that it ſhoulde be he him ſelfe, bicauſe they knewe well inough he was made ſure inough to mans reaſon, beeing kepte ſo ſtraytely in cloſe priſon: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon they concluded with them ſelues, and ſtrayghtwayes affirmed withoute more adoo, that it was his Angel, and not he, whom the damoyſell ſawe. By the very maner of which coniecture, ſee we not playnly, that S. Peter is iudged to haue a proper Angell? And by whom is he ſo iudged? Not by any prophane men,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:10354:231"/> but by the godly. And by a fewe of the godly? Nay (be you righte well aſſured of it) withoute any that reclaymed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt it, by that holy Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation that was there ſo godlily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. But they ſpake it (ſayth one) according to a general opinion that was then amongeſt them, wherby they were all of this beléefe, that euery faythfull Chriſtian had hys Angell. Nature then taughte it them belyke, or elſe alſo the worde of God. If it were naturally engrafte, it hadde néede then doubtleſſe to be a greate cauſe that ſhoulde moue vs to fighte agaynſte it: if it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs alſo by the woorde of GOD, with ſo muche the more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence wée ſhoulde receyue it. If it be confirmed and ratified by an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and vnifourme conſente, howe muche leſſe occaſion haue wée to doubte of it?</p>
               <p>Certaynly (whatſoeuer we ſay to the contrary) the wordes of oure Sauioure Chryſte, when ſpeaking of Childrens ſeuerall Angelles, he ſayth they are ſtill beholding his fathers face, are not ſo
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:10354:232"/> lightly and ſlenderly be ouerpaſſed. And if we make none account of them: what ſay we to our father Iſraell? Who bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Ioſephes two children, <hi>God</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>which hath fedde me all my life long vntill this day, and the Angell alſo which hath defended me from all euill, proſper and bleſſe theſe children.</hi> Which béeing ſpoken purpoſely of his proper Angell (as Eccleſiaſticall authors doo agree) ſhall we ſay it is but a ſclender proofe?</p>
               <p>O but in ſuche a Pſalme, where the felicitie of the godly is deſcribed, <hi>God hath giuen</hi> (ſayth the text) <hi>vnto his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 91.</note> 
                  <hi>charge ouer thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> I will not ſay here that theſe wordes pertayne onely to Chryſte. Let them alſo be applyed (on Gods name) to hys myſticall body, whiche is the Churche. But what ſhall wée then conclude? That GOD hathe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged eyther all, or at leaſtwyſe a great number of his Angelles particularely with euery eſpeciall manne? If all of them ſhoulde continually ſtande boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſuche a priuate charge: howe coulde that by any meanes agrée wyth
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:10354:232"/> their diffinitiue and circumſcribed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? For euery one of them (whiche were a thyng impoſſible) ſhoulde bée ſtyll preſente with their aſſiſtence, in howe many farre diſtaunte places at one tyme? Agayne if euery one of the faythfull ſhoulde haue a great mey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Angelles alwayes to looke to them: yet who ſéeth not, wythoute any neceſſitie, howe hugely oute of all meaſure the number of the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles ſhoulde bée increaſed? But true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſenſe wée néede not to force vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the wordes of the Pſalme, ſaying: <hi>God hath giuen his Angels charge ouer thee.</hi> The worde <hi>THEE</hi> in that place not ſignifying any eſpeciall perſon, but generally all faythfull people, compacte into one body vnder Chryſt their head. Ouer whome, béeing many, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Angelles ſhould be appoynted, it is no maruayle.</p>
               <p>Muche leſſe is the eſpeciall care of one Angell ouer one taken away by the generall ioy that they haue all of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted ſinner.</p>
               <p>Much leſſe doth the defenſe of many, by
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:10354:233"/> an eſpeciall priuiledge, at a néede preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice ones ordinarie protection. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no leſſe by Gods lawe, than by the courſe of nature, hath the chiefe charge of his owne children. And yet that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Eccleſiaſticus is notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note> a certayne truthe, where it is ſayd, that euery body hath a charge from God ouer his neighbour, whether he be hys chylde, yea or no. And may it not ſo fall out I pray you, in this caſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one Angel hauing the chiefe cuſtodie of one, yet ſo often as néede requireth, the reſt are not altogither diſcharged?</p>
               <p>But I will not too egerly contende, <note place="margin">The author doth not much contende for the matier of our priuate Angel, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier diſputable rather than much material to or fro.</note> for a thing that is not muche materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. I knowe ſome learned of late dayes diſſent, and yet dare I not condemne by and by the former ages conſent.

Therefore going aboute his mothers buſineſſe, whyles he tarryed abrode ſomewhat toolong, there fell a great ſnowe which couered all the hilles there about, &amp; being benighted, the poore childe knewe not howe to gette forthe.

               <p>Whereat <hi>Grinaeus</hi> being preſent, and hearing all that was ſayde, in the ende commeth vnto him, and telleth him, that foraſmuch as he had hearde him preache
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:10354:237"/> of the Sacrament, he woulde very faine haue ſome priuate conference with him, touching the ſame matter. <hi>Faber</hi> hearing this, with faire woords and louing lookes he made him anſwer, that he was righte glad of his parte to ſee the happie daye, wherein he might talke any thing with <hi>Grinaeus,</hi> and eſpecially of ſuch a matter, and willed him the next day after to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to him againe to his houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grinaeus</hi> thincking nothing, but that all had bene well, goeth his way, and comming againe to vs, telleth vs that to morow he muſt diſpute with <hi>Faber.</hi> But he in the meane time laying waite for <hi>Grinaeus,</hi> getteth himſelfe to a certaine noble man, and giueth him ful enforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Grinaeus,</hi> and at the laft he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of this honorable perſonage, that he wold charge the Senate with him, that he might be caſt into priſon. Héereupon when we were ſcarce ſet downe to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, commeth me in an olde man into our inne, and when dinner was done: he calleth me vnto him ſtanding before the gates, aſking me of <hi>Grinaeus,</hi> whether he were within: vnto whome I anſwered,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:10354:237"/> that he was ſo. Then quod the olde man, there is a great daunger hanging ouer his head, which if he be minded to eſchue lette him be gone hence with all ſpéede. Whereof when I had enfourmed <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> I perſuaded him to flie away with all haſte, and he followeth my counſell. Therfore riſing from dinner I, maiſter <hi>Cruciger,</hi> and he, forth we goe with oure ſeruauntes following at our héeles, and <hi>Grinaeus</hi> he went in the middeſt of vs. We had not yet paſſed four or fiue hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but the ſergeantes were in the Inne to ſeke <hi>Grynaeus.</hi> Where ſeing that they coulde not finde him, they ſought no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either becauſe they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſéeke him there only, or bicauſe that they knew vs not, or finally, bicauſe they were otherwiſe nothing cruelly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.

But no body coulde enfourme me, who he was, nor yet coulde I ſette eye vpon him euer after. This man ſurely I thinke was an Angel. Thus farre goeth <hi>Manlius</hi> with his declaration.</p>

Be vprighte as Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el was, and haue a like zeale to promote and further Gods kingdome, and then euen in the midſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lions den, I ſay, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art now deſtitut of al worldly ayde, the Lord himſelf which is carefull for thée, wil ſende thée his holy Angell that ſhal ſtir vp Habacuck. But there is no remedie, God muſt do al things for vs, euen as we will our ſelfe, or elſe we wil chafe &amp; murmur, and take on as we were lords of the earth. Of our own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane while we wil ſcarſe haue leaſure once to thinke. What reaſon, I pray you is in this? or how can we haue the face ſo to dele? God ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our harts I beſéech him for his great mercies, &amp; giue
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:10354:260"/> vs a ſound vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that we may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better conceiue of his woorks, and yéelde vnto him more frute of good life, that we may taſte at length in our ſelues the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſwéeteneſſe of the Lorde. Which if it come to paſſe, O howe holeſomely ſhould oure heartes be ſeaſoned with the licoure of this liuely iuice? howe ready would our tongues always be to breake oute into the praiſe of God? howe euill would our eares digeſt all blaſphemons ſlanders againſt God? Wherunto there is vtterly nothing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> could poſſibly more excite vs (as very wel ſayth <hi>Theodorete</hi> in his firſt oration <hi>de Prouidentia)</hi> than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of Gods louing kindneſſe, &amp; his dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſoueraintie ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world.</p>
               <p>Pacience likewiſe &amp; humilitie thoſe goodly vertues albeit that they may wel be compriſed vnder the argument of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

To them therefore, I ſay, to bothe of them what a ſpurre is the knowledge
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:10354:260"/> of Gods Prouidence? For if the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the world do all things iuſtely, and in good order (as we muſte néedes graunt all of neceſſitie, that will graunt at leaſtwiſe he is a God) what cauſe can we pretende in any wiſe, why we ſhould not ſubmit our ſelues willingly to hys yoke? If we thinke it appertenaunt to our office (as without all controuerſie it is) that we ſhould render due homage to a worldly Prince, who notwithſtanding of nature is but duſte and aſhes, as we be: ſhal we thinke ſcorne to humble our ſelues before him, who onely is our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure, before our only true Lorde, before God him ſelfe? Shal we take any thing paciently and quietly at mans hande: and ſhall we take ſcorne when we are touched with Gods? Nay, if we thinke it reaſon to beare the indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man, ſéeing we know he is but Gods inſtrument, of very force we muſt nedes take it well, whatſoeuer it is that God dothe. For man in déede may be tangled and wrapte in errour, either bicauſe it is out of his reache to foreſée all conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that may happen, or bicauſe he is
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:10354:261"/> caryed away by his affections, whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he is efteſones become thrall.

So is it not with God, be ye wel aſſured, who not only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth &amp; forſéeth all things, but is altogither voyde of paſſions &amp; perturbations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with creatures of fleſh &amp; bloud are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhaken (as it were) out of ioynte. Wherfore in al his doings is ſobrietie &amp; moderation, in him is wiſdome &amp; equity, &amp; without all extremitie iuſt dealing, as that kingly prophet Dauid, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> innocent Iob, as <hi>Mauricius</hi> the vertuous Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in his great anguiſhe and affliction full godlily &amp; ſoberly conſidered.

               <p>
                  <hi>Mauricius</hi> the Emperour in the end of his reigne became ſo excéeding couetous, that he refuſed to raunſome with a very little ſumme of money certen thouſands
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:10354:261"/> of captiues, taken priſoners of <hi>Caianus</hi> the king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Auares,</hi> who had offered for the ſaid litle ſum to dimiſſe them al with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out harme. Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Caianus</hi> ſéeing he was ſet at nought, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued no ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, &amp; forthwith w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>out ſparing any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cauſed them al to be put to the ſworde. In the yere following, which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 19 of <hi>Mauricius</hi> his empire, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne religious man hauing the ſpirit of prophecie, running bare headed and bare footed through the citie of Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople, prophecied in all mens hearing, that the Emperor ſhould be ſlaine with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſword. Herevpon the ſayd Emperour, when he had hardly eſcaped with his life, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſedition which was raiſed in the citie, conceyuing afterwardes a remorſe, he bethought him ſelfe, what a haynous treſpaſſe he committed, in ſuffering ſo many thouſandes to goe to wracke for his couetouſneſſe, and béeing touched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with repentaunce, he made hys earneſt prayer vnto God, that he mighte ſuffer his deſerued puniſhmente in this life. Therfore ſending his Embaſſadors with large guiftes, not onely throughe
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:10354:262"/> all the churches of his Empire, but alſo to the holy men which liued in the wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, he required them to helpe hym with their hartie prayers, that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing compaſſion of him, would voutſafe to giue him his puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this world.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie had thus earneſtly prayed, the ſame night after, by the great mercy of God, an auiſion was ſhewed vnto hym to his comforte. Wherin it ſéemed, that <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours auiſion.</note> béeing ſolemnly cited to appere, he heard a voyce from heauen, as it were of oure Lorde Ieſus Chryſt, ſaying: Bring me hither <hi>Mauricius.</hi> Vpon this the ſergean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and the catchpoles laying holde of him, bring him before Chriſte his iudge, who with his owne mouth ſpeaking to him: Where wouldeſt thou (quod he) that I ſhoulde recompence thée? here, or in the worlde to come? The Emperour hearing this, made anſwere: O Lorde that arte a louer of mankinde, and a iuſt iudge, here, rather than in an other <note place="margin">Albeit that god freely do forgiue oure ſinnes, yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes for diſcipline ſake he enioyneth vs temporall punishment in this life.</note> worlde. And forthwith this voyce from heauen commanded <hi>Mauricius,</hi> his wife <hi>Conſtantina,</hi> his ſons, and all that were
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:10354:262"/> of his bloud, to be deliuered into the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the warriour <hi>Phocas. Mauricius</hi> therfore ſo ſoone as he was awaked out of ſléepe, ſent haſtilie after <hi>Philippious</hi> his ſonne in lawe. Of whom at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming he firſt aſked forgiueneſſe, bicauſe alwayes before that day he had had him in a ſuſpition, and a ielouſie, as one that ſought trayterouſly and maliciouſly, not his death onely, but his Empire, and ſtrayghtwais telling him of his dreame, be demaunded what maner of man that <hi>Phocas</hi> was. Who when he had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red agayne, that he had the charge of a great bande of men, and that he was a raſhe yong man, but yet in all his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings very timorous. Well (quod the Emperour) if he be timorous, as you ſay he is, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſurely it is to be thought he is a murtherer. And the ſame night that he thus dreamed, a comete that ſhone forth very brighte in the element, confirmed this his auiſion to be true. Yea moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the very ſame day after, <hi>Magiſtria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Embaſſadour, which had bene ſent to the fathers in the wilderneſſe, came backe to this ſayd citie of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:10354:263"/> who declared to <hi>Mauricius</hi> in the name of theſe fathers of the deſerte, that God accepting his repentaunce, would ſaue his ſoule, and place him and al his houſhold with his ſaincts: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he ſhould be thruſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his empire with diſhonor &amp; danger of his life. Al which things ſo concording and agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon his deſtruction, <hi>Mauricius</hi> fell downe vpon his knées, and prayſed God, and committing all that he had to Gods gouernement, he nowe looked for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but when the date of thys dolefull day ſhould approche.</p>
               <p>Alas good Emperour (for it euen piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mine heart to remember from what an highe type of honour, yea from what a royall and flouriſhing eſtate he is thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen downe ſodaynely vnder the féete) within ſhorte time after, when <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> had charged his ſouldiers to pitche their tentes in the enimies grounde, in the harde and roughe ſeaſon of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a rebellion was ſtirred vp agaynſt him, wherein the ſame <hi>Phocas</hi> (into whoſe handes he hearde before in hys dreame howe he was deliuered) was in
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:10354:263"/> the fielde appoynted, and proclaymed Emperour of a great meynie of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that ſwarmed about him. Who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards departing to Conſtantinople, and there taking the citie into his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection (which was then brought into a great vprore, through the negligence of them that ſhoulde haue looked vnto it) he was eſtabliſhed in the throne of hys Empire, by the conſent of the Patriarch and all the people. O harde caſe: why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nowe flieth <hi>Mauricius</hi> for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge? Into a Monaſterie? But (welaway) it woulde ſtande hym but in a lyttle ſtéede. For ſoone after, when ſome woulde haue refuſed to ſubmitte them ſelues vnto <hi>Phocas,</hi> ſaying that their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Emperoure was yet alyue: thys ſayde <hi>Phocas</hi> was ſo gréeued at it, that he ſoughte nothing more earneſtly than the vtter deſtruction of hys Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſoure. And therefore ſendyng his warrioures in poſtehaſte to fetche him foorthwith out of his cloyſter, where he and hys noble familye woulde nowe full gladly haue hydde them ſelues: he cauſed them, béeing broughte
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:10354:264"/> to <hi>Calcedon,</hi> one after an other, to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably mangled and diſmembred.</p>
               <p>In the meane time with what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart was this poore Emperoure, trowe ye, the beholder of this terrible execution? But yet (ſuche was his chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conſtancie) when he ſaw his deare wife and children ſo vnmercifully hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of this bloudy Tyraunte, he neuer murmured, nor repyned agaynſt God: but conſidering how muche more he had deſerued by the iuſte rigour of Gods dome, with hands and heart lifte vp to heauen, he efteſones repeated this clauſe of the Pſalme, <hi>Iustus es domine, &amp; rectum indicium tuum.</hi> That is to ſay, thou arte <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> iuſte Lorde, and thy iudgement is right. And what elſe taught him this great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, but his ſetled perſuaſion of Gods Prouidence? Wherewith this godly and chriſtian Emperour, if he had not ſtayed and borne vp him ſelfe, ah, how woulde his heart haue bled (as it were) with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſorrow and heauineſſe? what deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſighes and vnquiet words would he haue vſed? But nowe that this peace of God hath poſſeſſed his charitable and
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:10354:264" rendition="simple:additions"/> milde breſte, not onely he beareth with a good will the mercyleſſe butchering of his deareſt friends: but he is ready alſo and willing his owne ſelfe to giue ouer his life in the ſame torments. Knowing therfore that in Gods ſighte the death of his ſaincts is precious, (to make an ende of this pitifull and heauy tragedie) like a méeke lambe, he yeldeth vp himſelfe into the furious Tyrants bloudy hands.</p>
               <p>I beſéech you now, that which moued you, let it alſo take place with vs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer miſerie we ſuſtayne, whatſoeuer ſorrowe or calamitie light vpon vs, let vs alwayes arme our ſelues with thys thought, that it is Gods only hande that is layd vpon vs. And therwithal ſo often as we call to minde that broade eye, that ſéeth and vicweth al things, that dredſul preſence that nowhere can be excluded, that eare that heareth euery man, ſpeake he neuer with ſo ſofte a voyce, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that pierceth to the very thoughts of our heart: Let vs obſerue in any wiſe that diuine precepte that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs by the good father <hi>Chryſoſtomus,</hi> in our counſels circumſpecte, in our ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
